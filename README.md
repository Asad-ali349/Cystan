# Cystan

"Cystan" is a sophisticated web application tailored for legal professionals, particularly advocates, 
to efficiently manage their clients. As part of this project, I integrated Google Maps functionality to maintain
accurate records of client locations, optimizing client management processes. Additionally, I incorporated secure 
Stripe payment methods to facilitate seamless and secure financial transactions within the platform.
